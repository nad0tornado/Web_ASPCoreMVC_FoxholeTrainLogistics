### Why this project?
During my job search from Jan - Mar 2023, I identified some key skill areas which were in high-demand in the industry including being able to use Asp .NET Core MVC, .Net Core 6.0 and TDD (Test-Driven Development). While I had some experience in these areas, I wanted to work on a project that would help to solidify these skillsets and increase my overall value as a Software Engineer - and I wanted the project to be engaging enough that I would want to keep working on it and see it to completion.

I was playing a lot of the mmo game known as "Foxhole" and I was quite involved with the logistics system they have in the game, particularly with trains. However, I noticed a gap in the kinds of tools that were available to streamline the process of managing a train network and managing freight shipments.

Having recently developed a really useful spreadsheet for calculating shipments, I decided that this would be an excellent opportunity for me to explore use of Asp .NET Core MVC + Entity Framework, so I thought why not build a tool that's both useful and is something that I can show in job interviews?

..And here we are!
